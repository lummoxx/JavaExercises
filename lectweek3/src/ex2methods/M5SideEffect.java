    A quote
    "Now, scale that down. If you were fairly good at writing side-effect free code,
    how much faster would you be at reasoning at what some existing code did?
    How much faster could you write unit tests? How confident would you feel that
    the code with no side-effects was guaranteed bug-free, and that users could limit
    their exposure to any bugs it did have?

    If code has no side-effects, the compiler also may have additional optimizations
    that it could perform. It may be much easier to implement those optimizations.
    It may be much easier to even conceptualize an optimization for side-effect free code,
    which means that your compiler vendor might implement optimizations that are
    difficult-to-impossible in code with side effects.

    Concurrency is also drastically simpler to implement, to automatically generate,
    and to optimize when code has no side-effects. This is because all the pieces can
    be safely evaluated in any order. Allowing programmers to write highly concurrent
    code is widely considered the next big challenge that Computer Science needs to tackle,
    and one of the few remaining hedges agains"
