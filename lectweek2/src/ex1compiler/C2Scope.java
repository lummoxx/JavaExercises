/*
    In computer programming, the scope of a name such as a variable,
    is the region of a program where the name can be used to refer to the entity
    (where the name is visible).

    Scopes are used to
    - Be able to reuse a name
    - Limit the access to something (reduce risk that something
    is (accidentally) misused by someone somewhere).

    In Java the most common scope is between { and } (i.e. a block,
    Java is a block scoped language)

    Inside a scope names must normally be unique (compiler will record in which
    scope the name is declared)
