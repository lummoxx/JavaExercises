/*
    A name is a term used for identification. Names can identify a
    class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely,
    or within a given context.

    What in the code below are names?
    - These are NOT names: public, void, 123, true, +, ...
    - These are names: program, s, i, doIt, Dog, ...

    Q: How can we distinguish a name?
    A: A name is *declared* somewhere (by us or someone else).
       A declaration introduces a name!

    Besides translating source code to byte code the compiler will keep
    track of all names:
    1) that they exists (are declared)
    2) what they represent (variable, method, class, ...)
    3) types

    During translation the compiler checks that the names are used in a
    correct/sound/meaningful way (compiler has a lot of built in rules).
    If bad usage a compiler error. This is a *great* service to us programmers.
    We don't need to run the program to check for errors (some types of).

        //out.println( 2 * b);     // Can't multiply int and boolean

        //doOther();     // doOther unknown method not declared

    // --------------- Method declarations ---------------

    // A method declaration because () and possible parameters
    // after name
    int doIt(int i) {
        return 2 * i;
    }

    // A class declaration, because of word class before name

        int age;
    }
